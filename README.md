# F1-Hype-Routine

A series of HA helpers, automations and scripts for F1 racing tracking.  
This uses HomeAssistant with the TeamTracker, Alexa Media Player and LIFX integrations to create a F1 race tracker based upon LIFX LED light strips.

It gets data from the ESPN API for the top 3 race positions and converts it into driver name, team name, team color.
Then announces positions on Alexa devices and creates 3 "car-colored" lights that race around the strip in race order.

1/2025 - Created a custom Chase effect in WLED (replacing Chase) that works for F1.
